What code draws the blade?
  -line(x, height-10, x+random(-10, 10), height-10-random(h));
  
What code makes the "lawnmower" come by? How often does it come by?
  -    rect(0, 0, width, height-15) - Makes the "lownmower" come by 
  -   if (random(1000) > 999) - How often does it come by

What's the point of the h variable?
- To set the height of the grass

What does the -10 do in the second and fourth arguments of the line function, height-10-random(h)? Why is it there?
- In the second argument -10 is how high the blades of grass will grow and the fourth argument is how quickly the blades grow.
